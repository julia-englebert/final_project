# final_project

This project is an exploration of the historical relationship between education and agriculture in the Midwestern United States. 

To see the final version of my app, visit:
https://julia-englebert.shinyapps.io/midwest_edu_ag/

For the code used to generate this app, check out the "final" folder of this repository, which contains code and data files, maps, plots, and charts included in the app.

Becuase of Githubs upload size limits, I was unable to upload the original datasets and GIS files used to generate the maps. You can download it yourself at nhgis.org, or use my_data.rds, which includes only the data used for this project. Original variable names can be found in my_codebook.xlsx. To see the code used to clean the data and generate the maps, check out ms_8.Rmd. 

To see the original plan for the app, which included interactive maps with more year & variable options, check out shiny-aspirations.Rmd in addition to ms_8.Rmd. With a free shiny account (and some unefficient code), I was unable to deploy this version of the app. Please note that in order to run it on your desktop, you would need to first download the GIS shapefiles from nhgis.org.
